==========
Compile
==========

$ cd src
$ make F90=<f90 compiler>

This will generate a binary "flac".

Supported compilers:
gfortran -- GNU, v4.2 or later, otherwise openmp is disabled
ifort    -- Intel
pgf90    -- PGI
f90      -- Sun Studio

The default is to build optimized binary with openmp. Several command line
options can build other type of binaries.

debug=1    -- debugging binary
omp=0      -- disable openmp
coverage=1 -- code coverage analysis (only for gfortran)
gprof=1    -- profiling

E.g. to make a debugging binary
$ make debug=1


==========
Run
==========

$ cd ../examples
$ ../src/flac test-subduction.inp

The description of input parameters can be found in doc/ directory.


==========
Plot
==========

$ cd ../util
$ make
$ ./flac2vtk ../examples

This will generate a series of VTK files (*.vts), which can be visualized by
several programs, e.g. ParaView, LLNL's VisIt, MayaVi.
